# Git Commands Guide for Beginners

Git is a powerful version control system that helps developers track and manage changes to their code. Whether you are working solo or collaborating with a team, Git ensures your changes are safe and can be easily managed. This guide will walk you through some basic Git commands to help you get started.

### Setting Up Git

Before using Git, you need to configure it with your name and email.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Creating a Repository

To start using Git, create a new repository for your project. If you already have a project, navigate to its folder, then initialize Git:

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init
```

This creates a new `.git` folder where Git will track changes in your project.

### Staging Changes

Git tracks changes to files, but before you commit them, you need to stage them. Use the `git add` command to stage files:

```bash
git add <file-name>
```

To add all modified files, use:

```bash
git add .
```

### Committing Changes

Once you have staged your changes, commit them to the repository with a message describing the change:

```bash
git commit -m "Add a new feature"
```

Each commit creates a snapshot of your project at a given time.

### Viewing Changes

To view the changes in your repository:

- **Check the status** of files (whether they are staged, modified, or untracked):
  
  ```bash
  git status
  ```

- **View the commit history** with:

  ```bash
  git log
  ```

This will display a list of commits along with details like the commit hash, author, and commit message.

### Branching and Merging

Git allows you to work on different features simultaneously by creating branches.

- **Create a new branch**:

  ```bash
  git branch <branch-name>
  ```

- **Switch to a branch**:

  ```bash
  git checkout <branch-name>
  ```

- **Merge a branch** into the current branch:

  ```bash
  git merge <branch-name>
  ```

If you want to create and switch to a new branch in a single step:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

### Handling Conflicts

When merging branches, conflicts can occur if changes to the same part of a file are made in both branches. If a conflict arises:

1. Open the file with conflicts. Git will mark the conflicting areas.
2. Edit the file to resolve the conflict.
3. After resolving, stage the changes:

```bash
git add <file-name>
```

4. Finally, commit the resolved merge:

```bash
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
```

### Working with Remote Repositories

To collaborate with others, you can use a remote repository. You can add a remote repository (e.g., GitHub) to your project.

- **Add a remote repository**:

```bash
git remote add origin <repository-URL>
```

- **Push your changes** to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

- **Pull changes** from the remote repository:

```bash
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

### Conclusion

These are the basic Git commands you'll need to get started. As you grow more comfortable with Git, you'll explore advanced features such as rebasing, stashing, and working with tags. Happy coding!
